This package contains example programs for the FreeType 2 library.

You can build it either using the Meson build tool (see `README.meson`
for  more details),  or  using GNU  Make,  following the  instructions
below.

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

  The Makefile contained in this  directory assume that the FreeType 2
  library sources are located in `../freetype`.  If you downloaded one
  of the stable  FreeType 2 source packages from our  server, you most
  probably have to rename its directory, for example:

    mv freetype-2.12.1 freetype       on Unix
    rename freetype-2.12.1 freetype   on Windows

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING


  First compile the FreeType 2 library, then say `make`.  However, you
  must rename  the directory of  the FreeType 2 library  to `freetype`
  (or create a symlink) before doing this.

  Note  that  the  demonstration  programs  include  a  tiny  graphics
  sub-system that includes 'drivers' to display Windows on Win32, X11,
  BeOS, Mac, and  OS/2.  The build system  should automatically detect
  which driver to use based on the current platform.

    X11 issues
    ----------

    When building the  demos, the build system tries to  detect X11 by
    using pkg-config.   If X11 is  not found, some demo  programs will
    not be able to display graphics and will fail.

    Users with  X11 installed in  a non-standard location  can specify
    the paths  to the development  headers and library by  passing the
    X11_CFLAGS and X11_LIBS variables on the command line.

    If you  don't have X11  at all, fix  the definition of  the `EXES`
    variable as described in the top-level Makefile.

    Recent versions of Mac OS X  no longer deliver X11 by default; you
    have  to  install 'XQuartz'  or  'xorg-server'  (the successor  of
    XQuartz).   Those  bundles  are  provided  by  distributions  like
    MacPorts or homebrew.


    Using a different build directory
    ---------------------------------

    If the `configure` script of the  FreeType 2 library is run from a
    separate build directory, it creates  a dummy `Makefile` file that
    sets some variables before including the top-level Makefile of the
    source directory.   This dummy Makefile  can also be used  for the
    'ft2demos' package to be compiled in a different build directory:

       make FT2DEMOS=1 -f /path/to/freetype/build-dir/Makefile

    If necessary, adapt  the `TOP_DIR_2` variable to make  it point to
    the 'ft2demos' source directory.
